# Issues & Suggestions

### General
- Fix typescript errors and remove // @ts-ignore lines.

### Pie Chart
Note that the Outer radius of the pie chart is 2px. The outer radius of the pie chart is 118px. This is 2px smaller than the SVG container (240px) to accomodate hover fill stroke.

#### Suggested Feature
- Add transition ease for the hover stroke.
- Tool tip that displays data (category, c02mg, percent) as user hovers.

### Legend
#### Suggested Feature
- Add transition ease for the text overflow reveal.
- When the user hovers over the legend category trigger the tooltip and hover stroke on the piechart. Forwardref?
